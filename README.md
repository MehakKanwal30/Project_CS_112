# Project_CS_112
2nd semester project to make fruit ninja 

We were given a project to create a game of our choice. I choose fruit ninja and tried my best to make somewhat of a copy of it.
Using the SDL2 libraries i.e SDL2, SDL2_music, SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf.

-IMPORTANT-
Download the files and run program through the exe file.
